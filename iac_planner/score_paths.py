"""
MapGridCostFunction This cost function class rates a trajectory based on how closely the trajectory follows a 
global path or approaches a goal point. This attempts to optimize calculation speed by using the same precomputed map 
of distances to a path or goal point for all trajectories. 

In the dwa_local_planner, this cost function is instantiated multiple times, for different purposes. To keep the 
trajectory close to the path, to make the robot advance towards a local goal, and also to make the robot front (
"nose") point towards a local goal. This cost function is a heuristics that can give bad results or even fail with 
unsuitable parameters.
